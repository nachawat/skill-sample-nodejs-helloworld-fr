# Build your First Alexa Skill

This Alexa sample Skill is a template to illustrate a basic hello world.

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end. The front end is the voice interface, or VUI. The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model. The back end is where the logic of your skill resides.

## Skill Setup Options

There are a number of different ways for you to setup your skill, depending on your experience and what tools you have available.

* If this is your first skill, choose the [Alexa-Hosted backend instructions](./instructions/00-setup-hosted-skill.md) to get started quickly.

* Developers with the ASK Command Line Interface configured may follow the [ASK CLI instructions](./instructions/01-setup-ask-cli.md).
